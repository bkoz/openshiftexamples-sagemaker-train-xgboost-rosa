# SageMaker Studio and Red Hat OpenShift on AWS Example
This is an example showcasing one simple way to connect SageMaker and ROSA.
- hyperparameter tuning, training, and detecting bias using AWS Sage Maker Studio
- containerizing and deploying to Red Hat OpenShift on AWS for scablable serving/inferencing

In terms of maturity we call this MLOps level 0. It is great for learning and demo but not recommended for production.
If you are interested in more advanced MLOps reference architectures integrating AWS ML and OpenShift, [please see here]().

## Running the example
Follow the guide below to try this yourself.

### Model tuning and training in your SageMaker Studio
TBD importing the notebook

### Deploying as an API into your ROSA cluster
TBD setup triggers or manual deploy steps

### Using OpenAPI docs to test the model
TBD

### Watching metrics in ROSA
TBD
